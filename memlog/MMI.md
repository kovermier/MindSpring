# AI Assistant Memory Management Instructions

## Core Functionality Requirements

1. CONVERSATION TRACKING
- Monitor and log all interactions between user and AI
- Save metadata including:
  * Timestamps
  * Context/topic
  * Success indicators ("that worked", "perfect", etc.)
  * Code snippets and their execution results
  * File paths referenced

2. SOLUTION VALIDATION
- Track successful solutions via user confirmation
- Flag and store:
  * Working code snippets
  * Verified troubleshooting steps 
  * Confirmed answers
- Create "ground truth" database from validated solutions

3. MEMORY INDEXING
- Implement efficient retrieval system:
  * SQLite for primary storage
  * Pagination for memory management
  * Lazy loading of conversation content
  * Index by topic, date, and success status

4. QUERY INTERFACE
- Enable natural language queries of past conversations
- Support code-specific searches
- Allow filtering by:
  * Date range
  * Topic
  * Success status
  * File type/language

5. CONTEXT AWARENESS
- Track current VS Code workspace
- Monitor file changes and git status
- Link conversations to specific projects/files

## Implementation Priority

1. ESSENTIAL (Phase 1)
- Basic conversation logging
- SQLite storage setup
- Simple query capability
- Success tracking

2. ENHANCED (Phase 2)
- Code snippet validation
- Context linking
- Advanced search
- Memory optimization

3. ADVANCED (Phase 3)
- RAG integration
- Ground truth database
- Automated learning from successful solutions
- Performance optimization

## Memory Management Guidelines

1. STORAGE
- Use SQLite for primary data
- Implement pagination (20 items per page)
- Lazy load conversation content
- Cache frequently accessed items

2. OPTIMIZATION
- Clear unused memory regularly
- Implement cleanup routines
- Monitor system resource usage
- Provide lightweight mode option

3. BACKUP
- Regular SQLite database backup
- Export capability for conversations
- Backup validation system
- Recovery procedures

## Success Validation Protocol

1. INDICATORS
- Track explicit confirmation ("that worked")
- Monitor positive feedback
- Log successful code execution
- Record solution application

2. VERIFICATION
- Confirm solution reproducibility
- Track multiple successful uses
- Log related context
- Store complete solution path

## Query System Design

1. SEARCH CAPABILITIES
- Full-text search
- Code-specific search
- Topic-based filtering
- Time-based queries

2. RESULTS FORMATTING
- Prioritize validated solutions
- Include context
- Show success metrics
- Link to original conversation

## Extension Integration

1. VS CODE HOOKS
- File system watchers
- Editor state tracking
- Command palette integration
- Status bar indicators

2. PERFORMANCE MONITORING
- Resource usage tracking
- Performance metrics
- Auto-scaling features
- Resource optimization

## Error Handling

1. RECOVERY PROCEDURES
- Database corruption handling
- Memory overflow protection
- Query timeout management
- Graceful degradation

2. USER NOTIFICATION
- Resource usage warnings
- Performance impact alerts
- Error state communication
- Recovery suggestions
