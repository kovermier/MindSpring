### Resources


## Next Steps
1. **Advanced Topic Analysis:**
    - Implement topic clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to group similar topics.
    - Develop trend analysis tools to identify emerging topics and patterns over time.
    - Extract key insights and summaries from clustered topics.
2. **Usage Statistics Dashboard:**
    - Create a dashboard to visualize conversation frequency, topic distribution over time, and user interaction patterns.
    - Implement metrics to track search usage, popular topics, and overall system engagement.
3. **Enhanced Knowledge Graph Visualization:**
    - Add interactive features to the knowledge graph, such as filtering by topic, time range, or user.
    - Implement topic-based clustering to visually group related nodes.
    - Add a timeline view to explore topic evolution over time.
    - Improve the visual layout and styling of the graph for better clarity and readability.
4. **Conversation Summarization:**
    - Implement automatic summarization of conversations to provide concise overviews.
    - Explore different summarization techniques (e.g., extractive, abstractive) to optimize for different conversation types.
5. **User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Improvements:**
    - Refine the UI for better navigation and discoverability of features.
    - Improve the search experience with auto-suggestions, filters, and sorting options.
    - Enhance the visual presentation of data with charts, graphs, and interactive elements.
6. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the application, especially for large datasets.
    - Explore caching strategies to reduce loading times and improve responsiveness.
    - Optimize database queries and vector store operations for faster search and analysis.
7. **Integration with External Tools:**
    - Explore integration with other tools and services, such as cloud storage, collaboration platforms, and data visualization libraries.
8. **Documentation and Testing:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for all features and functionalities.
    - Develop automated tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
