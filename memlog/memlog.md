## Memolog

### 2024-11-23 [Vector Store Integration]
- Successfully integrated Ollama embeddings with Qdrant:
  1. Fixed load_conversations.py to properly use ConversationVectorStore
  2. Successfully processed all conversation chunks (1297 GPT, 874 Claude, 37 model comparisons)
  3. Verified semantic search functionality in UI
  4. Improved error handling and progress tracking

### 2024-11-29 [UI Consolidation]
- Major updates to improve search and visualization:
  1. Enhanced Topic Map with full vector store integration
  2. Improved semantic search with relevance controls
  3. Added similar conversation recommendations
  4. Removed SQLite dependencies
  5. Consolidated knowledge graph visualization
  6. Improved UI/UX with better styling and navigation

### 2024-11-29 [Automated File Processing]
- Enhanced load_conversations.py with automatic JSON file splitting:
  1. Added file size threshold detection (5MB)
  2. Implemented file watcher for new JSON files
  3. Integrated splitting directly into load_chunks process
  4. Added automatic directory creation for chunks

### 2024-11-29 [Lock File Resolution]
- Resolved a FileExistsError related to a stale lock file ('qdrant_db/.lock') preventing vector store initialization. The lock file and the qdrant_db directory were removed, allowing successful initialization and testing.  The test_load_and_search.py script was executed successfully, demonstrating proper functionality.

### 2024-11-27 [Ollama API Fix]
- Resolved the Ollama API issue by correcting the input key in `conversation_vector_store.py`. The API is now functioning correctly.

### 2024-11-27 [Database Loading Optimization]
- Significantly improved the performance of database loading by processing and inserting conversations one by one in `load_conversations.py`. This reduced disk I/O and improved processing speed.

### 2024-11-28 [Project Status Update]
- Ollama API integration is now fully functional. Next steps involve implementing advanced topic analysis and usage statistics.

### 2024-11-29 [Obsolete SQLite Removal]
- Successfully removed the obsolete SQLite database implementation. The `conversations.db` and `init_db.py` files were deleted. The data flow now relies solely on Qdrant for vector storage.

## Next Steps
1. Implement advanced topic analysis features
   - Topic clustering
   - Trend analysis
   - Key insights extraction
2. Add usage statistics dashboard
   - Conversation frequency
   - Topic distribution over time
   - User interaction patterns
3. Enhance knowledge graph visualization
   - Add more interactive features
   - Implement topic-based clustering
   - Add timeline view

## Implementation Notes
- Use consistent timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Tag blockers with "BLOCKER:" prefix for easy searching
- Keep daily logs in reverse chronological order
- Link related tasks with #tag-references

## Automated Tracking Hooks
- Git commit messages should reference task IDs
- Use #blocker, #progress, #completed tags for automation
- Daily log entries should include status updates
